Spinal cord injuries (SCI) can result from trauma, tumors, infections, or degenerative diseasesâ€”and they often lead to partial or complete loss of movement, sensation, or control over bodily functions. Immediate medical care is crucial. At Care and Cure Hospital in Ahmedabad, spinal cord injury treatment involves a multidisciplinary approach including emergency care, neurosurgery, medication to reduce inflammation, and long-term rehabilitation. The hospital offers advanced imaging to assess the extent of injury and performs surgeries to decompress or stabilize the spinal cord.
